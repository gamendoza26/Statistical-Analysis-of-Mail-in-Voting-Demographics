Some possible research questions include:\n\nHow is whether an individual voted by mail/absentee and their sex (categorical) associated with their “thermometer” rating of the NRA (quantitative)?\nHow is the party of an individual’s Presidential vote and their race (categorical) associated with their “thermometer” rating of Black Lives Matter (quantitative)?\n\nFor the first research topic, our hypothesis is that males who did not vote by mail are more likely to have a higher “thermometer” rating for the NRA. Conversely, we expect women who did vote by mail to have lower “thermometer” ratings for the NRA.\nFor the second research topic, our hypothesis is that Republican Caucasians are more likely to have a lower “thermometer” rating for BLM while Democratic people of color are more likely to have a higher “thermometer” rating for BLM."

However, the increase in production has been directly associated to the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest. This culture began in the South and moved toward the central region of the country, spreading gradually to its northern part. This growth was mainly based on monoculture properties controlled by large transnational corporations, and has replaced the local biome: the Amazon rainforest. Such fact has worried both public and private entities, since there has been an excessive deforestation and biodiversity loss. This study analyses the advance of soybean in the North of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, in the period 1984-2009, by means of satellite image interpretation. As a result, presents three maps of land use development in the area of study. It is noticed that the recent deforestation was due to the livestock activities and, afterwards, the eroded soil from the open fields and pastures were recovered with the soybean crops. In other words, in the analyzed area, soy plantations were not directly established over the deforested areas, but rather over areas previously degraded by livestock.\n2nd article: It discusses the complex relationship between climate change, vegetation, and water resources in the Amazon. The authors explore how climate feedback mechanisms, such as the water and energy cycles, are affected by deforestation, land use changes, and greenhouse gas emissions, leading to changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and vegetation cover. These changes, in turn, have significant impacts on the hydrological cycle and water resources, affecting the Amazonian ecosystem and its inhabitants. The article concludes by highlighting the urgent need for better understanding of these feedback mechanisms and the implementation of strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the Amazon region.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nThe first article cited provides insights into the relationship between deforestation and soybean cultivation in the Brazilian Amazon. The second cited article focuses on the complex relationship between climate change, vegetation, and water resources in the Amazon, while my research question focuses on the relationship between deforestation, carbon emissions, and burns in the Amazon. Thus, my research question builds on the article’s discussion of the impact of land use changes on the Amazon’s climate and vegetation by specifically examining the relationship between deforestation and carbon emissions in the region."

The data composed of both pre- and post- election samples from Fresh Cross-Sectional and ANES 2016-2020 Panel, and only included U.S. eligible voters. The interview formats varied from individual to individual, including through their website, a mix of their website and phone calls, and mixed internet video. The pre-election interviews took place from August 2020 and went until Election Day, Tuesday November 3rd. Post-election interviews began shortly after and ended December 31st. We do not believe that the variability in the collection of data outlined above creates any potential ethical issues.\nIt is important to note that the data set presents different variables depending on whether the response was pre or post election. The pre-election survey included variables on sexual harassment and misconduct, health insurance, immigration, identity politics, media trust and misinformation, institutional legitimacy, campaigns, party images, trade tariffs and tax policy. The post-election survey includes voting experiences, attitude toward public health officials and organizations, anti-elitism, faith in experts/science, climate change opinions, gun control opinions, opioids, rural/urban living, international trade, sexual harassment and MeToo, transgender military service, social media usage, opinions on misinformation, and personal experiences.\nOur research question is “How does whether an individual voted by mail/absentee and their sex alignment associate with their ‘thermometer’ rating of the NRA?”.

Compared the entire sample average rating of 48.6, men had an average rating of 50.5, individuals who voted in-person had an average rating of 55.8, and men who voted in person had an average rating of 57.9. Conversely, women assigned the NRA an average rating of 46.9, individuals who voted by mail assigned a rating of 43.5, and women who voted by mail had an average rating of 42.2.\nLogarithmic Regressions Analysis:\nThe logarithmic regression models demonstrates a similar result to the summary statistic analysis. For example, in the first model where we calculate the percent change that an individual voted in person (1) vs voting by mail (2), we see a negative correlation of \\(log(p/1-p) = 1.44864 * -0.01089 * ThermometerRating\\). This clearly demonstrate the negative correlation, where for every one point increase in the approval of the NRA, there is a decrease in the likelihood that an individuals voted in person (it gets closer to 1 from 2)."
